```

## stats

Returns an object with words and occurrances

```javascript
var words = wordify.stats("the the the the man man man sat on the the the cat cat cat cat");
```

Returns:

```javascript

```

## chunk

```

Returns:

["this should be in first element,", "this should be in second element"]
```
## wave

["the", "cat sat", "on the mat"]
```

```

Returns:

```javascript

```

## charCount
